Break down the initiative into atomic tasks.

Use the `task-decomposition` skill for the methodology.

Ensure:
1. All tasks < 4 hours
2. Clear dependencies mapped
3. Parallel opportunities identified
4. Critical path calculated
5. Milestones defined

Output as a structured task list with todo tracking.
