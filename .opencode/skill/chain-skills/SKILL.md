# Skill: Chain Skills

> Document and execute skill chaining for composed workflows with defined contracts and triggers.

---

## Purpose

This skill defines how skills can invoke other skills automatically, creating composed workflows. It establishes:

- Chain contracts between skills
- Trigger conditions
- Data passing protocols
- Error handling strategies

**Use when**:
- Building multi-step workflows
- Connecting skill outputs to inputs
- Creating automated pipelines

---

## Approaches

### Quick (15 min)
- Define simple linear chain: A -> B
- Document trigger condition
- Add chain section to both skills

### Complete (1 hour)
- Full chain topology design
- Typed data contracts
- Error handling
- Validation steps

### Incremental
- Start with one chain link
- Add more as patterns emerge
- Evolve contracts over time

---

## Main Prompt

```
Implement **skill chaining** to create a composed workflow from multiple skills.

## Chain Definition
- **Source Skill**: [Skill that initiates the chain]
- **Target Skill**: [Skill to be invoked]
- **Trigger Condition**: [When to chain]
- **Data Contract**: [What data flows between skills]

---

## Phase 1: Chain Design (PLANNING)

### A. Choose Chain Topology

1. **Linear Chain**: A -> B -> C
   ```
   extract-patterns -> create-skill
   ```

2. **Conditional Chain**: A -> (if X) B (else) C
   ```
   audit-code-review -> (if security issues) security-fix
                     -> (else) debt-report only
   ```

3. **Parallel Chain**: A -> B, C (concurrent)
   ```
   create-api -> create-tests, create-docs
   ```

4. **Loop Chain**: A -> FOR EACH -> B
   ```
   extract-patterns -> FOR EACH skill: create-skill
   ```

5. **Recovery Chain**: A -> ON ERROR -> B
   ```
   deploy -> ON ERROR -> rollback
   ```

### B. Define Contract

```yaml
chain_link:
  source: [source-skill]
  target: [target-skill]
  trigger: [condition expression]
  input:
    - field_name: type
  output:
    - field_name: type
  error_handling:
    on_failure: abort | continue | retry
```

---

## Phase 2: Documentation (EXECUTION)

### A. Update Source Skill README

Add section:
```markdown
## Skill Chaining

### Chains to: [target-skill]
- **Trigger**: [When to invoke]
- **Input**: [Data passed to target]
- **Output**: [Expected result from target]
```

### B. Update Target Skill README

Add section:
```markdown
## Can Be Chained From

- **[source-skill]**: Receives [input description]
```

---

## Phase 3: Execution Protocol

When executing a chain:

1. **Complete Source Skill** up to chain point
2. **Evaluate Trigger Condition**
3. **If triggered**:
   a. Prepare input data per contract
   b. Log: `>> CHAIN TO: [target-skill]`
   c. Execute target skill with input
   d. Capture output
   e. Return to source if needed
4. **If not triggered**:
   a. Log: `>> CHAIN SKIPPED: [reason]`
   b. Continue source skill

---

## Phase 4: Validation

Verify chain:
- [ ] Source skill completes to chain point
- [ ] Trigger condition evaluates correctly
- [ ] Input data properly formatted
- [ ] Target skill receives and processes
- [ ] Output captured if needed
- [ ] No infinite loops possible
- [ ] Error handling works

---

## Constraints

- **No Circular Chains**: A -> B -> A is forbidden
- **Explicit Contracts**: All data must be typed
- **Graceful Failures**: Chain failure shouldn't crash source
- **Logging Required**: All chain events must be logged
```

---

## Chain Patterns Reference

### Pattern 1: Result-Based Chain

```
IF skill_output.contains(HIGH_PRIORITY) THEN chain
```

**Example**: extract-patterns -> create-skill

### Pattern 2: Error-Based Chain

```
IF skill_result == ERROR AND error.recoverable THEN chain to recovery
```

**Example**: deploy -> rollback

### Pattern 3: Completion Chain

```
AFTER skill_completes THEN always chain
```

**Example**: implement-feature -> run-tests

### Pattern 4: Threshold Chain

```
IF metric > threshold THEN chain
```

**Example**: audit-code-review -> escalate (if critical > 3)

---

## Contract Template

```yaml
chain:
  id: unique-chain-id
  pattern: linear | conditional | parallel | loop | recovery
  
  source:
    skill: skill-name
    completion_point: phase or condition
  
  trigger:
    type: condition | completion | error
    expression: "boolean expression"
  
  target:
    skill: target-skill-name
    input_mapping:
      target_field: source.expression
  
  output_handling:
    capture: boolean
    field_name: result
    
  error_handling:
    on_target_failure: abort | continue | retry
    max_retries: 3
```

---

## Example: extract-patterns -> create-skill

```yaml
chain:
  id: pattern-to-skill
  pattern: conditional
  
  source:
    skill: extract-patterns
    completion_point: Phase 3 complete
  
  trigger:
    type: condition
    expression: "skill_candidates.filter(s => s.priority == 'HIGH').length > 0"
  
  target:
    skill: create-skill
    input_mapping:
      skill_name: candidate.name
      domain: candidate.domain
      objective: candidate.objective
  
  execution:
    mode: loop
    for_each: "skill_candidates.filter(s => s.priority == 'HIGH')"
```

- Any skill needing composition
- `extract-patterns`: When documenting new chains

### Chains To
