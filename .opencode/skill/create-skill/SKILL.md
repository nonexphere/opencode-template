# Skill: Create Skill

<!-- @META: Skill Factory -->
<!--
    File: .opencode/skill/create-skill/SKILL.md
    Version: 3.0.0
    Created: 2025-12-21

    Scope: Methodology for creating new skills
-->

<!-- @NOTE(skill-def): Definition -->
> The meta-skill to create, document, and validate new skills following the official OpenCode standard.

---

## Purpose

<!-- @NOTE(purpose): Purpose -->
This skill defines the complete lifecycle for creating new skills in the OpenCode environment. It moves beyond simple prompt writing to a structured engineering process.

**Use when**:
- You identify a recurring task (executed > 3 times).
- You need to standardize a complex process.
- You are extracting a pattern from existing code/docs.
- You want to share a capability with other agents.

---

## Skill Identification Methodology

<!-- @RULE: Identification -->
Not everything should be a skill. Use this matrix to decide:

| Criteria | Threshold for Skill Creation |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **Frequency** | Task performed > 3 times manually or by agents. |
| **Complexity** | Requires > 5 steps or involves multiple files/tools. |
| **Risk** | High cost of error (e.g., security, db migration) requires strict protocol. |
| **Cognitive Load** | Requires looking up docs or context every time. |

**Decision Algorithm**:
1. Is it a one-off? -> **No Skill** (Use temporary prompt).
2. Is it simple (1 step)? -> **No Skill** (Use direct command).
3. Is it recurring AND (complex OR risky OR specialized)? -> **CREATE SKILL**.

---

## Skill Discovery Patterns

<!-- @NOTE(patterns): Discovery -->
Use these patterns to uncover hidden skills in your codebase:

### 1. "The Repeater" (Code Duplication)
- **Signal**: Similar code blocks in multiple files (e.g., API endpoints, UI components).
- **Skill**: `create-endpoint`, `create-component`.
- **Action**: Abstract the template into a skill.

### 2. "The Ritual" (Manual Process)
- **Signal**: "Always run X after Y" or long checklists in PR descriptions.
- **Skill**: `deploy-sequence`, `verify-release`.
- **Action**: Automate the checklist via a skill.

### 3. "The Fixer" (Recurring Bugs)
- **Signal**: Same type of bug fixed multiple times (e.g., "Fix useEffect dependency").
- **Skill**: `audit-react-hooks`, `fix-pattern-x`.
- **Action**: Create an audit skill to catch it early.

### 4. "The Lore" (Tribal Knowledge)
- **Signal**: "Ask Bob how to do this" or specialized knowledge in one person's head.
- **Skill**: `explain-architecture`, `guide-setup`.
- **Action**: Document the knowledge as an interactive skill.

## Extracting Implicit Skills

<!-- @NOTE(extraction): Extraction -->
How to turn existing code/docs into a skill:

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. **Gather Samples**: Collect 3-5 examples of the task being done correctly.
2. **Identify Variables**: What changes between examples? (Names, paths, types).
3. **Identify Constants**: What stays the same? (Structure, imports, error handling).

### Phase 2: Abstraction
1. **Create Template**: Replace variables with placeholders (e.g., `{{feature_name}}`).
2. **Define Rules**: Explicitly state the logic for the "Constants".
3. **Draft Prompt**: Combine Template + Rules into the Main Prompt.

### Phase 3: Codification
1. **Structure**: Apply the OpenCode Skill Format.
2. **Constraints**: Add "MUST" and "MUST NOT" rules based on past failures.
3. **Validation**: Test the skill on a new case to ensure it produces the expected result.

## Official OpenCode Skill Template

<!-- @SCHEMA: Official Template -->
Create new skills in `.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md` using this EXACT format:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name-kebab-case
description: Clear, one-sentence description of what this skill does.
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  category: [meta|backend|frontend|fullstack|devops]
  complexity: [low|medium|high]

## Validation Checklist

<!-- @RULE: Validation -->
Before marking a skill as "Ready", verify:

1. **Naming**:
   - [ ] Lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens (kebab-case).
   - [ ] 1-64 characters.
   - [ ] Action-oriented (e.g., `create-api` not `api-creator`).

2. **Structure**:
   - [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter.
   - [ ] Contains `Main Prompt` section.
   - [ ] Located in correct directory: `.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`.

3. **Prompt Quality**:
   - [ ] **Context**: Does it explain *what* the agent is (Role)?
   - [ ] **Objective**: Is the goal clear and measurable?
   - [ ] **Constraints**: Does it forbid bad patterns?
   - [ ] **Examples**: (Optional) Are there few-shot examples?

4. **Safety**:
   - [ ] Does it warn about destructive actions?
   - [ ] Does it require user confirmation for high-risk tasks?
